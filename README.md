# Zero-knowledge-proof-VC
## Note
This repository contains some corresponding smart contracts and programs of zero knowledge proof of ZoKrates, and they can be used for the proposed digital identity management frame based blockchain's smart contracts of zero knowledge proof.

***●***  The document, Contracts, contain four smart contracts:    
           (1) Cert_Status_SC.sol:  The smart contract of status managment of verifiable certificates.    
           (2) cert_isused_sc.sol:  The smart contract of status managment of zk_proof.  
           (3) Cert_ZK_Proof.sol:   The smart contract of verifying whether zk_proof is valid.  
           (4) VerifySignature.sol: The smart contract of verifying whether the digital signature of IDP is valid.  
        
***●***  The document, ZoKrates, contain some files related with zero knowlwdge proof:   
           (1) Cert_ZK_Proof.zok: The zero knowledge proof program of verifiable certificate.  
           (2) Cert_ZK_Proof.sol: The original smart contract of verifying whether zk_proof is valid and it is generated by Cert_ZK_Proof.zok.   
           (3) proof.json: The zero knowledge proof, zk_proof, and its format is JSON.  
  
 On the other hand, the development manual of ZoKrates can be found in https://zokrates.github.io/gettingstarted.html#one-line-install.
